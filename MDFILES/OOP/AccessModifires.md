# Access Modifiers
We have four types of access modifiers in Java.

### Default
- The purpose of this modifier is that the _variables_, _methods_, _classes_ etc. are only visible
inside a certain package
- They can only be used inised a certain package

### Public
- When we use the `public` access modifier we are letting all _classes_ and packages use
variables, methods etc. freely
- Basically as the name suggest everything is public and accessable while inside the same
project

### Protected
?

### Private
- `private` access modifier is the opposite of `public`
- When we use it on a certain _variable_ inside a _class_ it becomes, as the name suggest,
private and can only be accessed and modified from within same _class_
