# String methods

There a lot of string methods in Java here are some that are the most useful.

Example of `equals`, `equalsIgnoreCase`, `toUpperCase` methods.
```java
  public class Main{
    public static void main (String[] args){
        String name = "Bro";
        System.out.println(name.equals("Bro"));//true
        System.out.println(name.equalsIgnoreCase("bro"));//true
        System.out.println(name.toUpperCase());//BRO
    }
}

```
There are much more methods that are used to manipulate Strings in java, these are some of the bascis.
