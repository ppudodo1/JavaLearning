# Wrapper Classes

Wrapper class provides a way to use primitive data types as reference data types. The difference 
between these two is that reference data types contain useful methods for example `String` is by 
default a reference datatype therefore it contains useful methods that we exaplained in another 
file. They can also be used with _collections_ like `ArrayList`.

Primitive:                          
- boolean                           
- char
- int
- double

Wrapper:
- Boolean
- Character
- Integer
- Double
## Autoboxing
- Autoboxing is the automatic conversion that the Java compilter makes between primitive and referemce
data types

## Unboxing
- Is the reverse of the autoboxing. Automatic conversion of wrapper class to primitive
