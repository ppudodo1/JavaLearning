# Wrapper Classes

Wrapper class provides a way to use primitive data types as reference data types. The difference 
between these two is that reference data types contain useful methods for example `String` is by 
default a reference datatype therefore it contains useful methods that we exaplained in another 
file. They can also be used with _collections_ like `ArrayList`.
